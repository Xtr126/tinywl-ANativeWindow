/**
 * Based on ASurfaceTransaction_OnBufferRelease from AOSP
 * The ASurfaceTransaction_OnBufferRelease callback is invoked when a buffer that was passed in
 * ASurfaceTransaction_setBuffer is ready to be reused.
 *
 * This callback is guaranteed to be invoked if ASurfaceTransaction_setBuffer is called with a non
 * null buffer. If the buffer in the transaction is replaced via another call to
 * ASurfaceTransaction_setBuffer, the callback will be invoked immediately. Otherwise the callback
 * will be invoked before the ASurfaceTransaction_OnComplete callback after the buffer was
 * presented.
 *
 * If this callback is set, caller should not release the buffer using the
 * ASurfaceTransaction_OnComplete.
 *
 * \param context Optional context provided by the client that is passed into the callback.
 *
 * \param release_fence_fd Returns the fence file descriptor used to signal the release of buffer
 * associated with this callback. If this fence is valid (>=0), the buffer has not yet been released
 * and the fence will signal when the buffer has been released. If the fence is -1 , the buffer is
 * already released. The recipient of the callback takes ownership of the fence fd and is
 * responsible for closing it.
 *
 * THREADING
 * The callback can be invoked on any thread.
 *
 * Available since API level 36.
